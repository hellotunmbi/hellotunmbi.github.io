Welcome to Tunmbi’s (@hellotunmbi) GitHub Page.

This page describes a little of what I do, am doing and I have done…Projects I have worked on or currently working on.

I intend to share as much as possible and contribute to as many communities I can possibly.

For now…below are just default texts. Am keeping them there to guide in the use of Markdown syntax … lol. As I get used to them, i’ll remove them.

You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run Jekyll to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
